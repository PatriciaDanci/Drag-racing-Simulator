Drag Race Simulator 🏎️💨

Welcome to the Drag Race Simulator! This project is a simulation of a drag race implemented in VHDL using Vivado and tested on the Nexys A7 Artix-7 FPGA board.


Overview:

The Drag Race Simulator replicates the exhilarating experience of a drag race, where two vehicles compete to reach the finish line first. The simulation provides a realistic representation of acceleration, speed, and timing.

Features:

🚗 Realistic Vehicle Dynamics: Simulates acceleration and speed characteristics of vehicles.

🏁 Race Timing: Precisely measures the time taken for each vehicle to complete the race.

📊 Performance Analysis: Provides insights into vehicle performance through detailed metrics and statistics.


Implementation Details:

🛠️ Developed in VHDL using Vivado IDE.

🧠 Tested and validated on the Nexys A7 Artix-7 FPGA development board.


Usage:

~Connect the Nexys A7 FPGA board to your computer.

~Upload the project files to Vivado IDE.

~Synthesize and implement the design.

~Connect the FPGA board to a monitor or display for visual output.

~Start the simulation and enjoy the drag race experience!
